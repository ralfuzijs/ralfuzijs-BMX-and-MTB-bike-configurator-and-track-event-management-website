- Users can input their height, and the system will automatically recommend the most suitable BMX/MTB frame size based on predefined data.
#### 2. BMX Configurator:
- The platform allows users to select various bike parts, such as the frame, handlebars, wheels, and other components, and see the BMX bike in a 2D or 3D view, showing how it will look when assembled.
- Users can input their current BMX bike model and make changes, such as replacing the frame, handlebars, and other parts.
#### 3. MTB/BMX Track Map:
- A map displaying MTB and BMX tracks in Latvia, providing detailed information on each track.
#### 4. User Profile:
- Users can create accounts, save their BMX configurations, access them at any time, and receive notifications about events at their favorite MTB/BMX parks.

### Project Goals:
- Provide users with the ability to customize their BMX bikes online using an intuitive configurator.
- Ensure easy access to information about MTB/BMX tracks in Latvia.
- Combine interactivity and user experience with high-quality visual representation, using 2D or 3D modeling technologies.
