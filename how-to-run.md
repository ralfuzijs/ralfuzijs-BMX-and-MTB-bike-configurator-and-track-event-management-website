# How to Run the BMX/MTB Website

This guide explains how to run both the frontend Vue.js application and the backend API server that powers the BMX/MTB website.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or newer recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (local installation or access to MongoDB Atlas)

## Running the Backend API Server

The backend API server handles track data storage and retrieval.

1. Navigate to the API directory:
   ```bash
   cd map-tracks-api
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure the database:
   - Make sure MongoDB is running on your system
   - On Windows, you may need to start the MongoDB server with administrator permissions:
     1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator
     2. Run the following command:
        ```bash
        net start MongoDB
        ```
   - The default connection string in `.env` is set to `mongodb://localhost:27017/bike_tracks_db`
   - If needed, modify the `.env` file with your MongoDB connection details

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   This will start the server using nodemon, which automatically restarts when changes are detected.

   Alternatively, to run in production mode:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. The API server should now be running on port 5000 (default). You can test it by visiting:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000/api/tracks
   ```

## Running the Vue.js Frontend

The frontend provides the user interface for the website.

1. Navigate to the Vue project directory:
   ```bash
   cd vue-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. The Vue application should now be running. Open your browser and visit:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```
   
   The exact URL will be shown in your terminal after starting the development server.

## Accessing the Admin Page

To access the admin page where you can add new tracks:

1. Make sure both the backend API server and the Vue frontend are running
2. Navigate to the admin page in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/admin
   ```

3. Use the form to add new tracks to the database:
   - Enter the track name
   - Select the track type (skatepark, pumptrack, bmx_track)
   - Add a description (optional)
   - Enter the location coordinates (longitude and latitude) - you can find these using Google Maps
   - Add an image URL (optional)
   - Click "Add Track"

## Building for Production

To build the Vue.js frontend for production:

1. Navigate to the Vue project directory:
   ```bash
   cd vue-project
   ```

2. Run the build command:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. The built files will be in the `dist` directory, which can be deployed to a web server.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter connection issues with the API, make sure MongoDB is running and accessible
- Check that the ports (5000 for API, 5173 for Vue dev server) are not being used by other applications
- If changes to the frontend aren't reflecting, try clearing your browser cache
